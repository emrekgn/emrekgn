I’m a Staff Software Engineer with 12+ years crafting backend platforms around real-time data, distributed systems, and microservice architectures. I’ve led architecture for AI-powered healthcare and defense products, shipping high-performance, event-driven systems that move millions of events per second with clarity and rigor.

From early-stage bets to large-scale rebuilds, I stay hands-on across Java 17/21, Spring Boot, Python, PostgreSQL, and cloud-native tooling—always optimizing for scalability, performance, and developer experience. I thrive in collaborative teams where clean interfaces, resilient pipelines, and thoughtful observability are the norm.

Open to backend and technical leadership roles across Europe, MENA, and EMEA. Let’s connect.
